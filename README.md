# Rust 3D engine thing

Learning how to make my own "3D engine" with OpenGL in Rust.

Will probably contain horrific code.


Goals:
- [x] Get a basic window up and running
- [x] Draw a triangle
- [ ] Draw a cube
- [ ] .obj file parsing
- [ ] Draw meshes from .obj files

Stretch goals:
- [ ] Textures
- [ ] Lighting
- [ ] PBR rendering
