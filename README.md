# Rust 3D engine thing

Learning how to make my own "3D engine" with OpenGL in Rust.

Will probably contain horrific code.


Goals:
- [x] Get a basic window up and running
- [x] Draw a triangle
- [x] Draw a cube
- [x] .obj file parsing (Provided by TinyOBJ, not my own parser)
- [x] Draw meshes from .obj files
- [x] High level abstractions for stuff like objects (something with a mesh and a transform) and scenes (a collection of objects)

Stretch goals:
- [x] Textures
- [ ] Lighting
  - [ ] Shadowmapping
- [x] PBR
